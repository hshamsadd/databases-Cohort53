# Setup your first database

**Before** your first session, you need to set up PostgreSQL. Please follow the [PostgreSQL setup guide](Postgresql-setup.md) first.

# Reading Material Databases Week 1

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 1:

0. [PostgreSQL setup guide](Postgresql-setup.md) to set up your PostgreSQL instance.
1. [Introduction to databases](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/README)
    - What is an information (system)?
    - What are entities?
    - What is a database?
    - What is the role of a database in an application?
2. [Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL)](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/README)

    - How to use SQL to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD)
3. [Using database dumps](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/dumps)
4. [Career Training II (Interview preparation)](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation)

## Week goals

This week we want to introduce you to the world of databases! We will start with a general introduction of what databases are, go over some terms and explain how to start thinking about your application's data. Have a look at the introduction [here](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/README).

In this module, we will be cover both the relational type of databases (SQL), as well as document based databases (NoSQL). For now you do not need to know the difference, that will become apparent when we have covered both. We will start by going into relational database by learning about SQL, which is the language used when interacting with most relational databases. Have a look [here](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/README).

Lastly, let's go over some practical information that will allow you to save your databases and share it with others! Learn all about database dumps [here](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/dumps). Note that PostgreSQL uses `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` instead of MySQL's `mysqldump`.

## Career training II (Interview preparation)
Finally, it is time to continue with developing your soft skills to ace those job interviews. For that, have a look at the [interview preparation repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation). It is a lot to get through, so you may need some time next week as well. There is an assignment for the career training next week, you can already have a look at it if you find these things difficult.
