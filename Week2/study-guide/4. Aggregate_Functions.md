### What are Aggregate Functions, GROUP BY, HAVING, and DISTINCT?

These are powerful tools in SQL that help you summarize and filter your data in smart ways.

#### Aggregate Functions: Summarizing Your Data

These functions take a bunch of values from a column and give you one single answer. They are great for getting quick summaries.

*   **`COUNT()`:** Counts how many rows (items) there are.
*   **`SUM()`:** Adds up all the numbers in a column.
*   **`AVG()`:** Calculates the average of numbers in a column.
*   **`MIN()`:** Finds the smallest number or the earliest date/alphabetical item in a column.
*   **`MAX()`:** Finds the largest number or the latest date/alphabetical item in a column.

#### `DISTINCT`: Finding Unique Items

This keyword helps you see only the unique values in a column, removing any duplicates.

#### `GROUP BY`: Grouping for Summaries

When you want to use aggregate functions on *groups* of data, you use `GROUP BY`.

#### `HAVING`: Filtering Groups

`HAVING` is like `WHERE`, but it filters groups of data *after* they have been created by `GROUP BY`.

### Simple Examples: Aggregate Functions, GROUP BY, HAVING, DISTINCT
Let's use a simple `Products` table to demonstrate these concepts.

**1. In pgAdmin 4 (SQL)**
Please open your pgAdmin 4 Query Tool and use `AggregateFunctions.sql` file to create and fill our example tables.

**2. In Node.js**
Please open your terminal use `AggregateFunctions.js` file to create and fill our example tables.


### Exercise

Given a `Sales` table:

**`Sales` Table:**

| sale_id | item_name | quantity | price_per_item |
|---------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 1       | Apple     | 5        | 1.00           |
| 2       | Banana    | 3        | 0.50           |
| 3       | Apple     | 2        | 1.00           |
| 4       | Orange    | 10       | 0.75           |
| 5       | Banana    | 1        | 0.50           |

1.  **pgAdmin 4:** Write an SQL query to find the total number of items sold for each `item_name`.
2.  **pgAdmin 4:** Write an SQL query to find the average `price_per_item` for all items.
3.  **pgAdmin 4:** Write an SQL query to list `item_name`s that have been sold more than 3 times in total (sum of `quantity`).
4.  **Node.js:** Create a new Node.js script that connects to your database and runs the query from exercise 1. Print the results to the console.



### The Main Idea (Essence)

SQL clauses like `JOIN` help you combine information from different tables. `SELF-JOIN` is a special trick to compare data within the same table. `ALIASES` give temporary nicknames to make your queries easier to read. `Aggregate Functions` (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`) help you summarize data. `DISTINCT` finds unique values. `GROUP BY` organizes your data into groups for summarizing, and `HAVING` filters those summarized groups. These tools are essential for asking smart questions and getting useful answers from your database!
