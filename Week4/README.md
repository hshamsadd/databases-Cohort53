# Reading Material Databases Week 4

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 4, all in MongoDB:

- [Embedded vs Normalised data modeling](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/embedded-vs-normalised.md)
- [Advanced MongoDB operations](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/advanced-operations.md)
- [Pagination](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/pagination.md)
- [Indexes in MongoDB](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/indexes.md)
- [Transactions in MongoDB](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/transactions.md)
- [SQL vs NoSQL databases](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql-vs-nosql-databases.md)

## Week goals

This week we are going to focus fully on MongoDB as the main example of a document-based database which is the most common subset of NoSQL databases. Let's start with some more advanced data modeling ideas by talking about the difference in [Embedded and Normalised data modeling (https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/embedded-vs-normalised.md).

To work with more complex data models, we also need some more advanced MongoDB operations. Have a look at the [Advanced MongoDB operations](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/advanced-operations.md) section to get acquainted with some of the more commonly used ones. After that, have a look at the [Pagination](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/pagination.md) section for a common use case with these functions.

Next let's address some of the topics that are theoretically the same as in SQL, but this time looking at how they work in MongoDB. Have a look at [Indexes](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/indexes.md) and [Transactions (https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/transactions.md).

Last, now that you have an idea of what both SQL and NoSQL mean and how they work, you're have to ask yourself when to use one over the other in the [SQL vs NoSQL](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql-vs-nosql-databases.md) section.
