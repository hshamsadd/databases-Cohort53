# Module #6 - Databases: Store and retrieve data with PostgreSQL (Backend)

![Databases](./assets/databases.png)

Have you ever thought about how your brain remembers things? It happens automatically for humans, but that's not the case for computers. Any time you go to a website and fill in some details in a form for example, that information needs to be saved somewhere. This "somewhere" is called a `database`.

In this module, you learn all about a fundamental part of any software application: how to (safely) store data, so that it can be used on-demand. You will learn how to structure and group data so that your apps know where to find and store the correct data.

## Learning goals

In this module, you get familiar with the complexity of storing data. By the end of it, you have learned:

- What is the meaning of a `database entity`;
- How to work with `Structured Query Language` (SQL);
- All about the `relational model`;
- How to recognise the `basic setup of a database`;
- Know about `PostgreSQL` as an example of a relational database system;
- Know `NoSQL` databases, with an emphasis on `MongoDB`.

## How to use this repository

### Repository content

This repository consists of 3 essential parts:

1. `README`: this document contains all the required theory you need to understand **while** working on the weekly assignment. It contains not only the right resources to learn about the concepts, but also lectures done by HackYourFuture mentors. This is the **first thing** you should start with every week
2. `MAKEME`: this document contains the instructions for each week's assignment. Start with the exercises rather quickly, so that you can ground the concepts you read about earlier.
3. `LESSONPLAN`: this document is meant for mentors as a reference. However, as a trainee don't be shy to take a look at it as well!

### How to study

Let's say you are just starting out with the Databases module. This is what you do:

1. The week always starts on **Wednesday**. First thing you'll do is open the `README.md` for that week. For the first week of `Databases`, that would be [Week1 Reading](/Week1/README.md).
2. You spend **Wednesday** and **Thursday** going over the resources and try to get a basic understanding of the concepts. In the meanwhile, you must implement any feedback you received on the preceeding assignments (from the Node.js module).
3. On **Friday** you start with the weekly assignment, found in the `MAKEME.md`. For the first week of `Databases`, that would be [Assignment W1](/Week1/MAKEME.md).
4. You spend **Friday** and **Saturday** playing around with the exercises and write down any questions you might have.
5. **DEADLINE 1**: You submit any question you might have before **Saturday 23.59**, in the cohort channel.
6. On **Sunday** you attend the Q&A session. There will be no new material, instead your questions will be be discussed and you can learn from others.
7. You spend **Monday** and **Tuesday** finalizing your assignment.
8. **DEADLINE 2**: You submit your assignment to the right channels (GitHub) before **Tuesday 23.59**. If you can't make it on time, please communicate it with your mentor and Jos√©phine.
9. Start the new week by going back to point 1!
